#
# Setting: pidfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file that the daemon writes its process ID
#          (PID) to. This is used by the startup and shutdown script to know
#          which process to monitor or kill.
# Default: None. Init script uses a filename of newrelic-daemon.pid in
#          the first directory from /var/run or /var/pid that is found.
#pidfile=

#
# Setting: logfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file to record log messages in. If this file
#          does not exist it is created. If it cannot be created the daemon
#          will not start up. The amount of information sent to this file is
#          controlled by the loglevel settings, defined below.
# Default: /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log
#logfile=/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log

#
# Setting: loglevel
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the level of detail of log messages sent to the log file. This
#          variable can control the log level for different subsystem at
#          different levels, although such custom usage should only be done at
#          the request of New Relic technical support. The simplest setting is
#          to use one of the following keywords, in increasing order of detail:
#          error - only error messages
#          warning - only warning and error messages
#          info - only minimal startup and shutdown info
#          verbose - slightly more verbose than info, not commonly used
#          debug - very verbose, includes messages only relevant to support
#          verbosedebug - extremely verbose, creates massive log files
# Default: info
#loglevel=info

#
# Setting: port
# Type   : String or Integer (1-65534)
# Purpose: Sets how the agent and daemon communicate. How this is set can impact
#          performance. The default is to use a UNIX-domain socket located at
#          /tmp/.newrelic.sock. If you want to use UNIX domain sockets then
#          this value must begin with a "/". If you set this to an integer
#          value in the range 1-65534, then this will instruct the daemon to
#          listen on a normal TCP socket on the port specified. This may be
#          easier to use if you are using a chroot environment.
#          In order to use a port in the range 1-1023, the daemon must be
#          started by the super-user. This is a fundamental OS limitation
#          and not one imposed by the daemon itself.
# Default: "/tmp/.newrelic.sock"
#port="/tmp/.newrelic.sock"

#
# Setting: ssl
# Type   : boolean
# Purpose: If you prefer the daemon to use the secure HTTP (https) protocol
#          when communicating with the New Relic collector servers, set this
#          to true.
# Default: true (as of version 3.6)
#ssl=true

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_bundle
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM
#          format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used
#          to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If ssl_ca_path
#          is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be
#          searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the
#          ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl
#          is set to false.
# Default: none
#ssl_ca_bundle=

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_path
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates
#          in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be
#          used to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If
#          ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first
#          followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This
#          setting has no effect when ssl is set to false.
# Default: none
#ssl_ca_path=

#
# Setting: proxy
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Some networks are configured to require the use of an egress proxy
#          server in order to communicate with the outside world. Since the
#          daemon needs to communicate with the New Relic data collection
#          servers you may need to instruct it to use a proxy server. Your
#          system or network administrator should be able to provide you with
#          the details.
#          This string is in the form [user[:password]]@hostname[:port] with
#          the user, password and port fields being optional. Some examples:
#          myusername:secret@10.1.1.1:12345
#          someuser@proxy.mydomain.com:4321
#          proxy.mydomain.com
# Default: none
#proxy=

#
# Setting: auditlog
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of a file to record all uncompressed, un-encoded
#          content that is sent from your machine to the New Relic servers.
#          This includes the full URL for each command along with the payload
#          delivered with the command. This allows you to satisfy yourself
#          that the agent is not sending any sensitive data to our servers.
#          This file must be a different file to the logfile setting above.
#          If you set it to the same name audit logging will be silently
#          ignored.
# Default: None
#auditlog=/var/log/newrelic/audit.log
